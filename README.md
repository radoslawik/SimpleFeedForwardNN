# Feed-Forward Neural Network

FFNN is a type of Artifcial Neural Network inspired from biological neural networks. Main feature of the this type of NN is lack of feedback. This makes it viable for simple classification problems, but not optimal for more sophisticated ones.
In this code i am using FFNN to predicted one of three classes for 2-dimensional points using only [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) and [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) - without any ML libraries.

### Algorithm
1. Initialize parameters
2. Forward propagation 
3. Calculate SSE
4. Back propagation
5. Repeat 2-4 till convergence

### Requirements
- Python installed (with NumPy and matplotlib)
